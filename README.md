# 🔍 VisualAlgo: Interactive Program Visualizer

**VisualAlgo** is an interactive tool for visualizing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It is designed to help students and developers understand how algorithms work step by step through graphical and console-based animations.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Visualizes popular **data structures** (Linked List, Array, Trees, Graphs)
- Step-by-step execution of **algorithms** with animations.
- **Graphical Mode** – Built using **SDL2 / GTK** for smooth visuals.
- **CLI Mode (ASCII Fallback)** – For systems without GUI support.
- Supports **play, pause, and step-through** execution.
- Written in **C language** for performance and portability.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Varun-Dobhal/VisualAlgo.git
cd VisualAlgo
npm install
npm run dev
```

🚀 Future Scope

Add support for more algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms).

Add playback controls (speed, rewind, forward).

Export visualizations as GIF/Video for learning material.

Online version (WebAssembly + C backend).

🤝 Contribution

This project is a prototype for learning purposes.
You can:

Add new algorithms

Improve the UI

Optimize animations

Write documentation
